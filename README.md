School Management System
Project Description
The school board has proposed the development of a computerized system to improve and optimize the management of various administrative tasks within the school environment. This system will concentrate on four primary areas: student information management, student performance management, teacher information management, and classroom management. The objective is to create a streamlined and user-friendly platform that will decrease manual workloads, reduce errors, and enhance overall administrative efficiency.
